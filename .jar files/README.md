For the Swing Calculator to properly work, there are a couple things you must do.
First, you must type in the 2 integers/numbers you want and press enter in each text box after you have typed the number.
Then, you can press the button that corresponds to the function you want the calculator to perform.
The pop-up box will reload and your answer will be displayed to the right of the second text box.
